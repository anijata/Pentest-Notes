* Enumeration using Nmap: sudo nmap -sV -p\<port\> --script=http-enum \<ip\>
* Technology Stack Identification with [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) or kali linux tool `whatweb`: Can be used to analyze the tech stack of the web application.
* If the website uses wordpress use `wpscan` to scan wordpress application and plugins on website.
* Directory Brute Force with [Gobuster](https://www.kali.org/tools/gobuster/): Example Usage - gobuster dir -u \<ip\> -w \<wordlist\> -t \<no. of threads\>
	* Common wordlist that can be used: /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
	* Not recommended for under the radar attacks due to the large amounts of network traffic generated from brute-forcing. 
* Security Testing with [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp): 
	* [Proxy](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings/tools/proxy): Set up proxy for an [external browser](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/external-browser-config).
	* [Repeater](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/repeater): Craft new requests or easily modify the ones in History, resend them, and review the responses
	* [Intruder](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder): Automated attacking from various angles.
* Debugging Web Content: Use [inspector tool](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/tips/index.html) in a browser to inspect page content, scripts, files.
* Inspecting HTTP Response Headers: Use the [network tab](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/) in browser developer tools to view request and response headers  
* Sitemaps and robots.txt:
	* [Sitemaps](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview#:~:text=A%20sitemap%20is%20a%20file,crawl%20your%20site%20more%20efficiently.): A website can highlight important information about pages on websites. Information is used by search engine crawlers leading to search engine optimization.
	* [robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro): Mechanism that disallows search engine crawlers to index a page. Used to disallow any sensitive information or overload site with request for a page.
* API enumeration: 
	* Using gobuster: gobuster dir -u \<url\> -w \<wordlist file\> -p \<pattern\>
		* wordlist to try: /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt
		* pattern file example: 
		  {GOBUSTER}/v1
	         {GOBUSTER}/v2
		* Use curl in conjunction with gobuster to craft and test requests. Make sure to also print headers the response.
	* Use burpsuite intruder and repeater modules. Repeater for testing various requests. Intruder for using wordlists to enumerate API methods.
* CSRF: forces an unwanted request for a user that is currently authenticated
	* Example: Assume a user is currently logged into a banking site. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request asking to transfer money which can be clicked by a user using XSS or phishing attack. User unintentionally sends the request to the banking site while they are authenticated
	 * Example: https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf
* XSS: 
	* Stored XSS: As an example if a form has an input field where the attacker places an payload in it. The values are then stored in a database. Later when the this stored value is obtained via a request it is going to placed in an html page where the browser will execute the payload.
	* Reflected XSS: Payload is placed in request. If a user clicks on the request and the website is designed in a way to place the payload inside the page content then the browser will execute the payload.
	* Example: https://shift8web.ca/2018/01/craft-xss-payload-create-admin-user-in-wordpress-user/
	* Use a user's session cookies to any website to hijack or use csrf requests to elevate your privileges. Make sure to check for cookie flags such as HTTPOnly or nonce that prevent csrf to plan attacks accordingly.
* Web shell: A remote shell that created by an attacker on a remote machine.
	* Bind shell: A webshell where the victim host listen for connections for the host
		* [Bind shell cheatsheet](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Bind%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md)
		* [Bind shell generator](https://www.revshells.com/)
	* Reverse web shell:  A webshell where the attacker host listen for connections from the host

* [[Directory traversal]]
* [[File Inclusion]]
* File upload: Vulnerabilities that come when the website allows us to upload files.
	* Uploading executable files: 
		* Assume if a web server uses php. Then use the opportunity to upload php files and execute them for webshell or reverse shell using file inclusion or directory traversal. Same idea applies other types of technologies other than asp instead of php.
		* Bypassing extension filters: Websites can filter what extensions can be uploaded. If one extension doesn't work then try another extension. Use [alternate extensions](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb/blob/master/attack/file-upload/alt-extensions-php.txt) to bypass the filter.
	* Uploading non-executable files:
		* Try write files using directory traversal on unintended location when uploading file. As an example if a filename field of the request contains a relative path such as '../../../../../../../test.txt' then it is possible to place a file in that directory path or even overwrite those files if the filename field is not properly sanitized.
		* As an idea try overwriting SSH key on the server of a user then use your own private key to perform a passwordless ssh login.
	* [Hacktricks File upload](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload)
* OS Command injection: Unsanitized inputs that causes arbitrary command executions on an OS.
	* Example: Assume that an application expects to take 'x' as input for a command and filters any other command other than 'x'. Then try 'x;y' which executes 'x' and then 'y'. Try various ways to bypass filter and inject commands in your input that cause a command execution.
	* Here is a command to determine if the shell used is cmd or powershell: "(dir 2>&1 *\`|echo CMD);&<# rem #>echo PowerShell"
	* Depending on the OS we can try reverse shell using ncat or Powercat for powershell so on.
