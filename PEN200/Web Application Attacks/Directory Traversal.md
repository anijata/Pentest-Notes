* Sample directory traversal: hxxp://host/meteor/index.php page=../../../../../../../../../home/offsec/.ssh/id_rsa
* Theory: Find URL parameters where files can be included for reading. If the path for the file is unsanitized we can use relative (../ or ..\\) and absolute paths to traverse directories from the Webroot of a system get files on the system. Note that ../ is used for linux and windows can accept either ../ or \\.. Try looking for any get url parameter where a file path is included.
* Firewalls can be configured to filter requests that contain relative paths. Try using URL encoding on the path to bypass the firewall filters. For example encode the dots as %2e%2e .Try encoding various other characters in the request.
* Webroot for linux: /var/www/html/
* Webroot for Windows: C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot
* www-data: User account used in linux for webserver. Its access privileges' determine what can be accessed in a directory traversal.
* Tools: Burp, cURL. Try not to user browser since its purpose is user friendliness
	* cURL --path-as-is parameter can sometimes be used to prevent cURL from squashing the relative paths in the url path 
* Testing the vulnerability:
	* Windows: 
		* C:\\Windows\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts
		* C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\
		* C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\web.config
	* Linux:
		* /etc/passwd
