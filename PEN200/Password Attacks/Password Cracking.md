* Offline password cracking
	* Use HashCat or JTR suite (John the Ripper).
	* hashid can be used to identify hash type.
	* Mutating wordlists or rule based attack is when you write rules to change wordlists for password cracking. For example an organization uses a password policy of 1 uppercase, 1 special, 3 numbers then can use rules to change wordlists to reflect the password policy and crack the password.
	* Hashcat: 
		* Example: hashcat -m \<hash id\> \<hash\> \<wordlist\> -r \<rule file\> --force
		* /usr/share/hashcat/rules/ contains Hashcat rules
		* hashcat -h | grep -i "\<insert service name\>" can be used to get hash id as well.
		* Hashcat wiki contains how rules can be built for hashcat.
	* John the ripper:
		* Example: john --wordlist=\<wordlist\> --rules=\<rule\> \<hash file\>
		* Append your rule to /etc/john/john.conf
		* JTR suite tools like keepass2john (Converts keepass password manager db file to crackable hash) and ssh2john (Converts ssh private key to a crackable hash for passphrase if any) to convert to crackable hashes
* Online password cracking:
	* `Hydra`: 
		* Conduct dictionary attacks against SSH, RDP, HTTP login.
		* Usage: hydra -l \<user\> -P \<wordlist\> -s \<port\> \<protocol\>://\<ip\>
		* protocol can be ssh, rdp, http, https
		* -l \<user\>can be replaces -L \<user list\> and -p \<password\> instead of -P \<wordlist\> which can be used for password spraying attack.
		* HTTP GET or POST form:
			* Example: `hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt \<ip\> http-post-form "/<url path>:<user parameter>=user&<password parameter>=^PASS^:<words from failure login page>"`
				* For http-post-form:
					* Can mention `C:/` for session cookie path. `:F=<http status>` code to indicate success or failure for login. 
					* `^USER64^`, `^PASS64^` can be used for base64 encoding. 
			* For GET replace with http-get-form
	* Wordlists for online password cracking:
		* If you dont have any accounts you can try a built in accounts like root, user, Administrator. Use username wordlists: /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/names.txt
		* You can use services like ScatteredSecrets which password leaks to try attacking. Of course the passwords used must not violate terms of service and may require permission from owner.
		* You can use linux tool like `crunch` to generate simple wordlist files:
			* Usage: `crunch <min> <max> [options]`
		* Mutate wordlists or rule based attack using hashcat or Jtr suite.
		* `CeWL`: Create a wordlist by spidering a URL for words to use for password cracking.
			* Usage: `CeWL <url>`
