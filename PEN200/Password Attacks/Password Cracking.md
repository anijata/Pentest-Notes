* Use HashCat or JTR suite (John the Ripper) for offline password cracking.
* hashid can be used to identify hash type.
* Mutating wordlists or rule based attack is when you write rules to change wordlists for password cracking. For example an organization uses a password policy of 1 uppercase, 1 special, 3 numbers then can use rules to change wordlists to reflect the password policy and crack the password.
* Hashcat: 
	* Example: hashcat -m \<hash id\> \<hash\> \<wordlist\> -r \<rule file\> --force
	* /usr/share/hashcat/rules/ contains Hashcat rules
	* hashcat -h | grep -i "\<insert service name\>" can be used to get hash id as well.
	* Hashcat wiki contains how rules can be built for hashcat.
* John the ripper:
	* Example: john --wordlist=\<wordlist\> --rules=\<rule\> \<hash file\>
	* Append your rule to /etc/john/john.conf
	* JTR suite tools like keepass2john (Converts keepass password manager db file to crackable hash) and ssh2john (Converts ssh private key to a crackable hash for passphrase if any) to convert to crackable hashes
