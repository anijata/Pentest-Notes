* Hydra: 
	* Conduct dictionary attacks against SSH, RDP, HTTP login.
	* Usage: hydra -l \<user\> -P \<wordlist\> -s \<port\> \<protocol\>://\<ip\>
	* protocol can be ssh, rdp, http, https
	* -l \<user\>can be replaces -L \<user list\> and -p \<password\> instead of -P \<wordlist\> which can be used for password spraying attack.
	* HTTP GET or POST form:
		* Example: hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt \<ip\> http-post-form "/index.php:fm_usr=user&fm_pwd=^PASS^:Login failed. Invalid" 
		* For GET replace with http-get-form
	* If you dont have any accounts you can try a built in accounts like root, user, Administrator. Use username wordlists: /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/names.txt
	* You can use services like ScatteredSecrets which password leaks to try attacking. Of course the passwords used must not violate terms of service and may require permission from owner.
	* You can use linux tool like `crunch` to generate simple wordlist files:
		* Usage: `crunch <min> <max> [options]`
	* Or mutate wordlists or rule based attack using hashcat or Jtr suite.
