* Manual enumeration:
	* Current user basic information: `id`
	* List sudo allow commands of the current user: `sudo -l`
		* Link explains more about sudoer and its capabilities: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-edit-the-sudoers-file
	* Enumerate all users: `cat /etc/passwd`
		* Provides information in the following format: username:encrypted password:UID:GID:Comment:Home Folder:Login Shell
	* Get hostname: `hostname`
	* Get OS release and version:
		* `cat /etc/issue`
		* `cat /etc/*-release`. files such as `/etc/os-release`
		* `uname -a`
	* Enumerate running processes: `ps aux`
	* Monitor linux processes using `pspy` (doesnt require root) to see operations and commands made by process.
	* List network interfaces: `ip a`
	* Display routing table: 
		* `route`
		* `routel`
	* Enumerate active network connections:
		* `netstat`
		* `ss -anp`
	* Firewall rules enumeration:
		* `iptables` requires root privileges.
		* `/etc/iptables` files can be worth a shot. Programs such as `iptables-persistent` package or `netfilter` save and use rules in these files and are left with weak permissions.
		* `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore` are commands used to dump or restore firewall configuration rules. As an example firewall rules can saved to a file `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`. If the file has weak permissions it can viewed.
	* Scheduled tasks: 
		* `crontab -l` lists current user's cron jobs.
		* `ls -lah /etc/cron*` for all scripts stored related to cron. These can be checked for weak file permissions.
	* Enumerating installed applications:
		* For Debian, can enumerate applications installed by dpkg package manager: `dpkg -l`
		* For Red Hat, can enumerate applications installed by rpm package manager.
	* Enumerate files where users may have carelessly left sensitive information such as usernames, passwords in config files, desktop, application folders, git repos etc. 
	* Enumerate files with writable permissions by the current user: `find / -writable 2>/dev/null` or `find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null`
	* Enumerate files with setuid bit in file permissions: `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
	* Enumerated mounted and unmount drives:
		* `mount` command lists all mounted drives.
		* `cat /etc/fstab` lists all drives that are mounted at boot time. 
		* `lsblk` lists available disks.
	* Enumerate loaded drivers and kernel modules: 
		* `lsmod` lists loaded kernel modules.
		* `sbin/modinfo <module name>` provides more info about a module.
* Automated enumeration:
	* unix-privesc-check:
		* Usage: `unix-privesc-check { standard | detailed }`
		* Standard is speed optimized. Detailed is slower but checks for permissions of open file handles and files.
