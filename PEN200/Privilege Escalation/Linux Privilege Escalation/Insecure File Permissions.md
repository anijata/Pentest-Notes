* Cron Job abuse:
	* Check for Cron jobs using `crontab` command and `/etc/cron*` files
	* Check for running Cron jobs using log files: `cat /var/log/cron.log` or `grep "CRON" /var/log/syslog`
	* Find a cronjob script file that is owned by and executed frequently by a high privileged  user and check if the file permissions allow the current user to modify it.
	* As example add an one liner reverse shell at the end of the script for a high level user shell
* Weak permissions on password files and password authentication:
	* For the sake of backwards compatibility, authentication checks  `passwd` file before `shadow` if the second column has a password hash. The entry in `passwd` file takes precedence over the respective entry inÂ `shadow`. If `/etc/passwd` has weak permissions, then its possible to add a highly privileged user with password. 
	* Generate a password hash using `openssl passwd <password>`
	* Add user to passwd file: `echo "<user>:<password hash>:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd`
