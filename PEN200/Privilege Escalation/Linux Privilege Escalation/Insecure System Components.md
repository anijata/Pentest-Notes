* Setuid binaries abuse:
	* Enumerate files with setuid bit in file permissions: `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
	* The higher the privileges of the owner the more it is possible to abuse the filesystem and obtain higher privileges.
*  Linux capabilities abuse
	* Capabilities are pieces of privileges that can be assigned to a file. 
	* List capabilities of file in directory recursively using: `/usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null`
	* Capabities can have effective bit (e) and permitted bit (p) assigned. Effective bit means the capability is currently active. Permitted means the file is allowed to use the capability.
	* [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#+capabilities) contains techniques for a list of binaries on how to abuse binaries with capabilities assigned. 
	*  If something goes wrong, try checking `/var/log/syslog`.
* Abusing Sudo:
	* List sudo allow commands of the current user: `sudo -l`
	* See what commands can be used to read, write, execute files.

	* If something goes wrong, try checking `/var/log/syslog`.
	* Kernel modules such as AppArmor, which provides MAC (Mandatory Access Control), may restrict your options. 
* Exploit Kernel vulnerabilities:
	* Get OS and version: `cat /etc/issue`
	* Get kernel verison: `uname -r`
	* Get system architecture: `arch`
	* Using the information gathered, search for a kernel exploit in searchsploit. Example: `searchsploit "linux kernel Ubuntu 16 Local Privilege Escalation"   | grep  "4." | grep -v " < 4.4.0" | grep -v "4.8"`
