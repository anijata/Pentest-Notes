* Assume machine 1 exists in network 1 and machine 2,3 belong to network 2. Machine 2 can communicate with both networks 1,2. Then machine 2 can be set up as a bridge using port forwarding for machine 1 in network 1 to communicate with machine 3 in network 2.

* Port forwarding using socat on machine 2: `socat -ddd TCP-LISTEN:<machine2 port>,fork TCP:<machine3 ip>:<machine3 port>`. machine 1 needs to connect to `<machine2 port>`.
* Alternatives:
		* rinetd. Appropriate for long term port forwarding. Not suitable for temporay purposes.
		* Netcat with FIFO.
		* if you have the permission to interact with iptables, then setup port forwarding by modifies rules on iptables.
