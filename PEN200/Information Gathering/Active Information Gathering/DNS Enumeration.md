DNS Enumeration is a cyclical process. An example of such a process: Do an enumeration on the domain -> Use the enumerated domains to obtain a decent idea of the ip range used. If the domain is configured with ptr records then reverse lookups should be possible which will allow us to enumerate domains associated with the range of ips. Another way expand the search is to use identify a format of a domain keyword such mail1, mail2. This may indicate that there may be a mail3 or mail4. Do active and passive information gathering on obtained results and repeat process.

Tools:
* host: Get DNS records of the target domain
* nslookup: Get DNS records of the target domain. Same as host but it is a windows utility
* dnsrecon, dnsenum: DNS enumeration tools that enumerates domains.
