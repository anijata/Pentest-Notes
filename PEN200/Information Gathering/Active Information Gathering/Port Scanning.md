* Using nmap:
	* TCP full port scan with os detection, script scanning: `nmap -A -T5 -p- <ip>` 
	* UDP port scan with version detection: `nmap -sU -SV -T5 -p- <ip>` 
	* nmap cheat sheet: https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/
	* nmap script scan: `nmap -p<port> <ip> --script <script>`
	* nmap vuln scan: `nmap -p<port> <ip> --script vuln`
* Banner grabbing:
	* If nmap is unable to find what service is running on a port then try banner grabbing using nc or telnet on the port.
	* If a banner doesnt appear after connecting with nc or telnet try inputting commands such as 'help', 'info' etc.
* Scanning though proxy:
	* Nmap scanning though proxy can be unreliable.
	* Transfer `NimScan.exe` to a host and scan the network from there. Using information of open ports available scan these ports from nmap via the proxy to reliably get results.
	* Alternatively use powershell to get open ports (its slow though).
