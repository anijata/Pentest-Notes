* The **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol** (**SMTP**) is an Internet standard communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. Usually runs on ports 25 (plaintext), 587 (encrypted).

Requests on SMTP:
* VRFY: A VRFY request asks the server to verify an email address
* EXPN: EXPN asks the server for the membership of a mailing list
* How to invoke:
	* After a TCP connection or a shell is established, invoke requests by VRFY \<email address\> or EXPN \<mali-box\>
* Note that if someone is not authorized to access information of the smtp server an access denied msg is received.

Enumeration techniques: 

* Use nmap to enumerate on port 25: Example: nc -nv \<ip\>
* Use python to enumerate on port 25: Example request: s.send(b'VRFY ' + user + b'\r\n')
* Use Test-NetConnection cmdlet on PowerShell to check if the service exists: Example: Test-NetConnection -Port 25 \<ip\>
* Use telenet to enumerate on port 25: Example: telnet \<ip\>
	* Note: telenet for a windows machine can be installed using the follwing command since its not instaled by default: dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient
