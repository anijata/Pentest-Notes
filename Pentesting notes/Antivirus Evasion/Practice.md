* AV Evasion testing:
	* To test if your malware is able to evade send it to for example VirusTotal which sends the file to various AV vendors for analysis and gets its results.
	* A disadvantage of VirusTotal is that after testing against the AV vendors it distributes the sample rendering your malware unusable later. Its equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot.
	* Use AntiScan.me instead or use another Antivirus tool that doesnt distribute the sample submitted. 
	* AntiScan.Me is considered a last resort when we don't know the specifics of our target's AV vendor.
	* As an example for windows defender, the sample distribution can be disabled.
* AV thread Injection:
	* Manual:
		* One of the main benefits of executing a script rather than a PE is that it is difficult for antivirus manufacturers to determine if the script is malicious as it's run inside an interpreter and the script itself isn't executable code.
		* As an example create a PowerShell script that imports functions (VirtualAlloc, Memset, CreateThread) and placed under a namespace.
		* Refer to the template [[AV thread Injection Template]]
		* Using the functions: Allocate memory using VirtualAlloc, Copy shellcode to the memory using Memset, Use CreateThread to launch.
		* Shellcode can be generated by msfvenom.
		* AVs rely on static string signatures related to meaningful code portions, such as variables or function names. Which means to bypass it one can change variable, function names, namespace etc.
	* Automated:
		* Shellter is a dynamic shellcode injection tool and is capable of AV evasion.
		* Shellter requires wine to work linux
		* Get a PE file and input it into Shellter. Shellter will analyze the file find an entry point and can place any payload of your choice.
		* As an example, take spotify exe a input into shellter, choose a meterpreter windows reverse tcp shell payload and distribute the file to your target. Assuming it was able to bypass AV, you have effectively backdoored using a non-malicious PE.
* Veil is another tool that can create files contain Metasploit payloads that are capable of evading AVs.
* One can create a bat file that launches a PowerShell with shell code.
