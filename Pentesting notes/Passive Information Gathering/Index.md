Tools and techniques:
* [[Google Hacking]]: Usage of google to search and narrow down information.
* [NetCraft](https://www.netcraft.com/tools/): Use it for finding out about domain, website frameworks used etc.. 
* [[Open-Source Code]]: Use open source repositories to find information.
* Website Source Code:
* [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/): A search engine that provide information about target IPs, ports, services, banner, footprints etc.
* Look for open ports using IP addresses with shodan: `for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done`
* [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com/): Analyzes website's security headers of a website and can show missing defensive headers.
* [SSL/TLS](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/): Analyzes a website's ssl/tls configuration and compares with best practices.
* [crt.sh](http://crt.sh/) Check for certificates and certificate transparency logs on crt.sh. This can reveal subdomains for a domain. 
	* Get company subdomains from crt.sh: `curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=<domain>\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u`
	* Alternatives: Censys
* DNS reconnaissance tools list: `dig,nslookup,host,whois,dnsenum,fierce,dnsrecon,theHarvester,Online DNS Lookup Services`
* DNS: Use host or dig command with company domain/subdomains name to get their IPs without interacting with company's dns servers.
	* `host <domain/subdomain>`
	* `dig any <domain/subdomain>`
* Check for Domain's WhoIs records:
	* Get information about: Domain Name, Registrar, Registrant Contact, Administrative Contact, Technical Contact, Creation and Expiration Dates, Name Servers.
	* `whois <domain/subdomain>` command or go to google websites for whois lookups. 
	* Can also check for all of historical changes made for Whois records on [WhoisFreaks](https://whoisfreaks.com/tools/whois/history/lookup)
* Websites to check for cloud resources of a domain: [domain.glass](domain.glass) , [GrayHatWarfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/)
* [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) : Check website archived pages on WayBack machine.
* Search employee information from social media such as LinkedIn.
* Username generation using names obtained from passive enumeration:
	* If you were able to get names from passive enumeration then they can be used to generate various possible usernames using [username-anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy)
	* [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username)
* OSINT passwords: You can use services like [ScatteredSecrets](https://scatteredsecrets.com/) or [Dehashed](https://github.com/sm00v/Dehashed/tree/master) which password leaks to try attacking. Of course the passwords used must not violate terms of service and may require permission from owner.
* Web reconnaissance frameworks: `Final Recon, Recon-ng, theHarvester, SpiderFoot, OSINT Framework`
