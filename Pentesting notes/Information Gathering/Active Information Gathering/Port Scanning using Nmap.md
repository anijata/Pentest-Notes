* Using Nmap:
	* Nmap cheat sheet: https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet
	* Nmap script db update: `nmap --script-updatedb`
	* TCP full port scan with os detection, default nmap scripts, os fingerprinting: `nmap -A -sC -T5 -p- <ip> [-v] [--packet-trace]` 
	* Nmap scan with service version scan `nmap -sV <ip> [-v] [--packet-trace]`
	* UDP port scan with version detection: `nmap -sU -SV -T5 -p- <ip> [-v] [--packet-trace]` 
	* Nmap host discovery scan: `sudo nmap <ip> -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping --reason`
		* Reference for more host discovery: `https://nmap.org/book/host-discovery-strategies.html`
* Nmap script scan:
	* Nmap default NSE script scan: `nmap -sC <ip>`
	* nmap specific script scan: `nmap -p<port> <ip> --script <script>`
	* nmap script scan with wild character: `nmap -p<port> <ip> --script <script>*`
	* nmap specific script scan by category: `nmap -p<port> <ip> --script <category>` 
		* Categories: `auth,broadcast,brute,default,discovery,dos,exploit,external,fuzzer,intrusive,malware,safe,version,vuln`
	* nmap vuln scan: `nmap -p<port> <ip> --script vuln`
	* `--script smb-os-discovery.nse`: smb os discovery.
	* Nmap script location: `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/`
	* Nmap nse scripts reference: https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html
* Banner grabbing:
	* Try nmap nse script: `banner.nse`
	* If nmap is unable to find what service is running on a port then try banner grabbing using nc or telnet on the port.
	* If a banner doesnt appear after connecting with nc or telnet try inputting commands such as 'help', 'info' etc.
	* Tcpdump/wireshark can also be used in conjunction with nc or telnet to observe exact details of packets.
* Optimizing performance of nmap scan:
	* RTT (Return Time Out) option: `--min-RTT-timeout <timeout>[ms]`
	* Retries option: `--max-retries <retries>`
	* Rate option: `--min-rate <rate>`
	* Scan speed template options: `-T [1|2|3|4|5]`
	* Reference: https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html
* Firewall, IDS/IPS evasion:
	* ACK scan: `-sA [--packet-trace]` option can be used to map out firewall rulesets, determining whether they are stateful or not and which ports are filtered.
	* Scanning with Decoys: `-D RND:<number> [--packet-trace]` hide your IP within randomly generated IPs to evade IPS. The IPs must all be real. (Note: All decoy IPs must be alive)
	* Spoof source address: `-S <ip>`. Works only if the source target address is on the same target as subnet. Prevents packets from being filtered.
	* DNS proxying: `--source-port 53` set port number to dns port on packets to prevent packets from being filtered.
	* Try reducing noise by scanning less ports at a time. Scan top n ports.
	* Reference: https://nmap.org/book/man-bypass-firewalls-ids.html
* Scanning though proxy:
	* Nmap scanning though proxy can be unreliable.
	* Transfer `NimScan.exe` to a host and scan the network from there. Using information of open ports available scan these ports from nmap via the proxy to reliably get results.
	* Alternatively use powershell to get open ports (its slow though).
