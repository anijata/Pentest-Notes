* SSH
	* Check if supports password authentication, permits empty passwords, root login, tunneling, port forwarding, outdated versions of encryption.
	* Specifying authentication method: `ssh -v <user>@<ip> -o PreferredAuthentications=<method>`.
		* Authentication methods: https://www.baeldung.com/linux/ssh-authentication-methods
	* ssh-audit: Checks for configurations and information on ssh.
		* `ssh-audit <ip>`
* RSync
	* Nmap scan: `sudo nmap -sV -p 873 <ip>`
	* Probing shares: `nc -nv <ip> 873`
	* Enumerating files and directories in a share: `rsync -av --list-only rsync://<ip>/<share>`
	* Rsync over ssh: Use `-e ssh` option with rsync command.

* R-Services
	* Enumerating Nmap: `sudo nmap -sV -p 512,513,514 <ip>`
	* Weakness: The `hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files on server contain a list of hosts (`IPs` or `Hostnames`) and users that are `trusted` by the local host when a connection attempt is made using `r-commands` which allows abused without authentication.
	* R-commands suite:
		* rcp: Copy a file or directory bidirectionally from the local system to the remote system (or vice versa) or from one remote system to another. It works like the cp command on Linux but provides no warning to the user for overwriting existing files on a system.
		- rexec: Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine. Requires authentication through the use of a username and password through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files.
		- rlogin:  Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to telnet but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files.
		- rsh: Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure. Relies upon the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files for validation.
		- rstat
		- ruptime
		- rwho (remote who)
		- rusers
