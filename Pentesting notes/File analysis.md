* `strings` command to check for any ascii strings in a binary
* `exiftool` check meta tags on a file.
* ADS (WIndows only): ADS (Alternate Data Stream) is way to store data in to a file but with a different stream. Using cat/type command will read out data from a default stream but if a file has multiple streams, then its possible to list the files along side with the ads using `dir /r` . Then read an ads using `more < <filename>:<ads file name>`
