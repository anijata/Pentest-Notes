		* `/docs`
		* `WEB-INF/web.xml`
		* `bin/conf/tomcat-users.xml`

proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)
proc.waitForOrKill(1000)
println sout
```

* Pentesting Splunk:
	* Runs by default on port 8000.
	* Default credentials are `admin:changeme`
	* RCE: Upload application from https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk/tree/master
		* Change rev.py for bash or run.ps1 for powershell.
		* If the compromised Splunk host is a deployment server, it will likely be possible to achieve RCE on any hosts with Universal Forwarders installed on them. To push a reverse shell out to other hosts, the application must be placed in the `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps` directory on the compromised host.
	* Check for vulnerabilities.
