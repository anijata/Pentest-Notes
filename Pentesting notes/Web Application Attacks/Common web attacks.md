* [[Directory Traversal]]
* IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)
	* If url parameter is `id=1` then try enumerating `id=n`
	* Use Burp to observe request involving idor vulnerable url parameters.
	* Try getting information or editing details using various values for idor vulnerable parameter. 
	* Check if the idor parameter is a combination of hashing or base64 encoding etc to enumerate using various values. 
	* Check web pages, web requests, frontend js functions, API calls for information on idor vulnerable parameter.
	* Use bash script, curl, burp and other fuzzing tools to automate idor. 
	* Try using HTTP Verb tampering or chaining with other vulnerabilities.
* HTTP Verb Tampering:
	* Try HTTP methods using Burp or curl: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH
	* Get allowed HTTP verbs using OPTIONS.
	* Change HTTP verbs to attempt auth bypass, security filters or input sanitizations.
* Web Mass Assignment Vulnerability:
	* Web mass assignment vulnerability is a type of security vulnerability where attackers can modify the model attributes of an object in an application through the parameters sent to the server.
	* Use burp to capture requests and add or remove parameters that are recognized by the application to insert, delete, modify objects in the database.

* CSRF: forces an unwanted request for a user that is currently authenticated
	* Example: Assume a user is currently logged into a banking site. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request asking to transfer money which can be clicked by a user using XSS or phishing attack. User unintentionally sends the request to the banking site while they are authenticated
	 * Example: https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf
* XSS: 
	* Stored XSS: As an example if a form has an input field where the attacker places an payload in it. The values are then stored in a database. Later when the this stored value is obtained via a request it is going to placed in an html page where the browser will execute the payload.
	* Reflected XSS: Payload is placed in request. If a user clicks on the request and the website is designed in a way to place the payload inside the page content then the browser will execute the payload.
	* Example: https://shift8web.ca/2018/01/craft-xss-payload-create-admin-user-in-wordpress-user/
	* Use a user's session cookies to any website to hijack or use csrf requests to elevate your privileges. Make sure to check for cookie flags such as HTTPOnly or nonce that prevent csrf to plan attacks accordingly.
	* Automated discovery tools: [XSS Strike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike), [Brute XSS](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/BruteXSS), and [XSSer](https://github.com/epsylon/xsser).
	* XSS Payloads: [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/README.md), [PayloadBox](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list)

* LDAP injection:
	* Special characters/operators to inject: `*, (), |, &, (cn=*)`
	* Use special characters/operators to bypass authentication.
