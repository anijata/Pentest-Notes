* [[Directory Traversal]]
* CSRF: forces an unwanted request for a user that is currently authenticated
	* Example: Assume a user is currently logged into a banking site. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request asking to transfer money which can be clicked by a user using XSS or phishing attack. User unintentionally sends the request to the banking site while they are authenticated
	 * Example: https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf
* XSS: 
	* Stored XSS: As an example if a form has an input field where the attacker places an payload in it. The values are then stored in a database. Later when the this stored value is obtained via a request it is going to placed in an html page where the browser will execute the payload.
	* Reflected XSS: Payload is placed in request. If a user clicks on the request and the website is designed in a way to place the payload inside the page content then the browser will execute the payload.
	* Example: https://shift8web.ca/2018/01/craft-xss-payload-create-admin-user-in-wordpress-user/
	* Use a user's session cookies to any website to hijack or use csrf requests to elevate your privileges. Make sure to check for cookie flags such as HTTPOnly or nonce that prevent csrf to plan attacks accordingly.
* [[File inclusion]]
* File upload: Vulnerabilities that come when the website allows us to upload files.
	* Uploading executable files: 
		* Assume if a web server uses php. Then use the opportunity to upload php files and execute them for webshell or reverse shell using file inclusion or directory traversal. Same idea applies other types of technologies other than asp instead of php.
		* Bypassing extension filters: Websites can filter what extensions can be uploaded. If one extension doesn't work then try another extension. Use [alternate extensions](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb/blob/master/attack/file-upload/alt-extensions-php.txt) to bypass the filter.
	* Uploading non-executable files:
		* Try write files using directory traversal on unintended location when uploading file. As an example if a filename field of the request contains a relative path such as '../../../../../../../test.txt' then it is possible to place a file in that directory path or even overwrite those files if the filename field is not properly sanitized.
		* As an idea try overwriting SSH key on the server of a user then use your own private key to perform a passwordless ssh login.

* OS Command injection: Unsanitized inputs that causes arbitrary command executions on an OS.
	* Example: Assume that an application expects to take 'x' as input for a command and filters any other command other than 'x'. Then try 'x;y' which executes 'x' and then 'y'. Try various ways to bypass filter and inject commands in your input that cause a command execution.
	* Here is a command to determine if the shell used is cmd or powershell: "(dir 2>&1 *\`|echo CMD);&<# rem #>echo PowerShell"
	* Depending on the OS we can try reverse shell using ncat or Powercat for powershell so on.
