* TIP: Try multiple wordlists if you have to during a pentest. 
* Basic methodology:
	* 1) Try VHOST/subdomain fuzzing.
	* 2) Fuzz with various page extensions to see what page extensions are allowed.
	* 3) Fuzz with pages. Try page extensions from step 2 or try finding more extensions that come with a new page. Use recursive search to search for directories and pages in directories.
	* 4) Fuzz with URL parameters names in GET, POST requests.
	* 5) Fuzz with values in a parameters.
	* Repeat steps with different wordlists.
* Directory busting:
	* Gobuster- `gobuster dir -u <ip> -w <wordlist> -t <no. of threads>`
	* Common wordlist that can be used: /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
	* Not recommended for under the radar attacks due to the large amounts of network traffic generated from brute-forcing. 
	* `-x <file extension>` to search for files with a that extension such as `php,txt` etc which are pretty popular with something like apache.
	* Alternatives:
		* feroxbuster: In addition to providing same as gobuster, it has a more automated way to search for sudirectories for found directories.  Use `-x` for file extensions and `-C` to blacklist any status codes `-r` for following redirects (sometimes better to disable redirects).
			* `feroxbuster [-r] [-s <status code>] --url <url> -w <wordlist> -x <file extension>`
		* nikto
		* fuff:
			* directory busting: `ffuf -w <wordlist>:FUZZ -u <URL>/FUZZ -ic [-r] [-fs <n>] [-fc <n>] [-mc <n>]`
			* page/extension busting:
				* Testing for a few extensions: `ffuf -w <wordlist>:FUZZ -u <URL>/FUZZ[.php|.aspx|.asp|.html|...] -ic [-r] [-fs <n>] [-fc <n>] [-mc <n>]`
				* Look for all extensions: `ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ <URL>/<page>FUZZ -ic [-r] [-fs <n>] [-fc <n>] [-mc <n>]`
			 * fuzzing with recursive and extension: `ffuf -w <wordlist>:FUZZ -u <URL>/FUZZ -e .php,.aspx,.asp,.html,... -recursion -recursion-depth <n> -v -ic [-r] [-fs <n>] [-fc <n>] [-mc <n>]`
	* Try `/usr/share/wordlists` wordlists or SecList (`/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/`) wordlists. 
	* For seclists try `common.txt`, `raft-...` wordlists. Try other kinds of wordlists depending on the situation. 
	* `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt` wordlist.
* URL parameter fuzzing:
	* GET Request Fuzzing using ffuf:
		* `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u <URL>/<page>?FUZZ=<data> -ic [-r] [-fs <n>] [-fc <n>] [-mc <n>]`
	* POST Request fuzzing using ffuf:
		* `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u <URL>/<page> -X POST -d 'FUZZ=<data>'  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -ic [-r] [-fs <n>] [-fc <n>] [-mc <n>]`
* Value fuzzing:
	* Get Request fuzzing using ffuf
		* `ffuf -w <wordlist>:FUZZ -u <URL>/<page>?<parameter>=FUZZ -ic [-r] [-fs <n>] [-fc <n>] [-mc <n>]`
	* POST Request fuzzing using ffuf:
		* `ffuf -w <wordlist>:FUZZ -u <URL>/<page> -X POST -d '<parameter>=FUZZ'  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -ic [-r] [-fs <n>] [-fc <n>] [-mc <n>]`
* VHOST/subdomain enumeration:
	* A VHOST can IP based port based or name based.
	* Enumeration can be done using wfuzz, ffuf, gobuster. Use wordlists in seclists/Discovery/DNS/ directory such as `namelist.txt`, `subdomains-top1million-110000.txt`.
	* Make sure to add a base domain to /etc/hosts/ file for VHOST enumeration.
	* Example vhost enumeration using fffuf:
		* `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u hxxp://basedomain.com -H 'Host: FUZZ.basedomain.com' -fs <size of http response to filter out>`
		* Using Gobuster: `gobuster vhost -u http://<target_IP_address> -w <wordlist_file> --append-domain`
	* Example sudomain fuzzing using fffuf: 
		* `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u hxxp://FUZZ.basedomain.com -fs <size of http response to filter out>`
* Fuzzing using request file: `ffuf -request req.txt -request-proto http -w <wordlist>:FUZZ`
