* Credential_stuffing: Attacking services with the default or obtained credentials.
	* When you encounter a service with login, first see if it can be cracked with default credentials.
	* Seclists's default credentials wordlist in `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials` directory and check if any default credentials are being used in a service.
	* [DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet/blob/main/DefaultCreds-Cheat-Sheet.csv?plain=1) can also be used.
* `Hydra`: 
	* Conduct dictionary attacks against SSH, RDP, HTTP login.
	* Use burp suite to get parameters in http authentication requests.
	* Usage: `hydra -l <user> -P <wordlist> -s <port> <protocol>://<ip>`
	* protocol can be ftp, ssh, rdp, http, https etc
	* `-l <user>` can be replaced with `-L <user list>` and `-p <password>` instead of `-P <wordlist>` which can be used for password spraying attack. If passwords are colon separated (like admin:password) then use `-C`
	* HTTP GET or POST form:
		* Example: `hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <ip> http-post-form "/<url path>:<user parameter>=^USER^&<password parameter>=^PASS^:<F|S>=<success/failed string>"`
			* For http-post-form:
				* Can mention `C:/` for session cookie path. 
				* `^USER64^`, `^PASS64^` can be used for base64 encoding. 
		* For GET replace with http-get-form
* medusa: `medusa -u <user> -P <password> -h <ip> -M <protocol>`
* Cracking Windows network services:
	* `crackmapexec`: `sudo crackmapexec <proto> <target-IP> -u <user or userlist> -p <password or passwordlist>`
	* Can be used to crack protocols: smb, winrm, rdp etc. 
* MetaSploit:
	* `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login` module.
* Wordlists for online password cracking:
	* Seclists's default credentials wordlist to check if any default credentials are being used in a service.
	* Password wordlists:
		* `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt` or `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
	* Username wordlists: 
		* Users like root, user, Administrator
		* `/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt`
		* `/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/names.txt`
	* Check if the service has password policies and tailor wordlists accordingly. Use tools like like sed or other string processing tools to remove candidates that don't conform to the password policy. 
	* `crunch`: Generate simple wordlist files using a character set and password lengths:
		* Usage: `./crunch <min-len> <max-len> [charset]`
	* Mutating wordlist with rule files using hashcat: `hashcat --force <worldist> -r <rule file> --stdout | sort -u > mut_password.list`
		* This mutated wordlist can used for hydra or crackmapexec etc
		* [rsmangler](https://github.com/digininja/RSMangler)
		* [mentalist](https://github.com/sc0tfree/mentalist)
	* `CeWL <url>`: Create a wordlist by spidering a URL for words to use for password cracking.
	* `cupp -i`: Generate a tailored wordlist using information such as firstname, lastname, birthdate etc.
	* `username-anarchy -i <names file>`: If you were able to get names from enumeration then they can be used to generate various possible usernames. 
	* You can use services like [ScatteredSecrets](https://scatteredsecrets.com/) or [Dehashed](http://dehashed.com/) which password leaks to try attacking. Of course the passwords used must not violate terms of service and may require permission from owner.
