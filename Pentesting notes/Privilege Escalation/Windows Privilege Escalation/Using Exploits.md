* First method: Use application vulnerabilities.
* Second method: Vulnerabilities in Windows kernel. Can be advanced since it requires in-depth. Discouraged since it can disrupt systems.
* Third method: Abuse user privileges such as [SeImpersonatePrivilege](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/seimpersonateprivilege-secreateglobalprivilege), SeAssignPrimaryToken, SeLoadDriver, and SeDebug.
	* SeImpersonatePrivilege, SeAssignPrimaryToken, SeLoadDriver, and SeDebug privileges can be checked for a user using "whoami /priv" 
	* [Remote procedure call](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rpc/rpc-start-page) or [Named Pipes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes) are ways to provide a client-server architecture to establish communication between two processes. 
	* A client process can make a request to the server. The server captures the authentication form the connection process.
	* The server uses SeImpersonatePrivilege to perform the request on behalf of the client with the client user security context therefore, impersonating the user account.
	* The priveldge escaltion vector is the how highly privelged the client process is. Higher the privledge more control the attacker has
	* [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) the tool forces the victim to uses printer spooler with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM into connecting to a controlled named pipe. This provides a SYSTEM token to the user.
	* [Potato family](https://jlajara.gitlab.io/Potatoes_Windows_Privesc) tools are alternatives similar to PrintSpoofer.
