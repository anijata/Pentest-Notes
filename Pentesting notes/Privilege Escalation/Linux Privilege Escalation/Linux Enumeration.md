* Manual enumeration:
	* Current user basic information such username, uid, gid and group memberships: `id`
	* List allowed sudo commands for the current user: `sudo -l`
		* Link explains more about sudoer and its capabilities: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-edit-the-sudoers-file
	* `sudo -V`: check sudo version and check vulnerabilities.
	* Enumerate all users: `cat /etc/passwd`
		* Provides information in the following format: username:encrypted password:UID:GID:Comment:Home Folder:Login Shell
	* Enumerate groups: `cat /etc/group`
	* Enumerate members in a group: `getent group <group name>`
	* Get hostname: `hostname`
	* Get OS release and version:
		* `cat /etc/issue`
		* `cat /etc/*-release`. files such as `/etc/os-release`
		* `uname -a`
		* Get distribution release: `cat /etc/lsb-release`
	* Get architecture: `arch`
	* Enumerate running processes: `ps aux`
		* Enumerate running processes by filtering with username: `ps aux | grep <user>`
	* Monitor linux processes using `pspy` (need to transfer) (doesnt require root) to see operations and commands made by process.
		* `./pspy64 -pf -i 1000`
	* List network interfaces: `ip a`
	* Display routing table: 
		* `route`
		* `routel`
	* Enumerate active network connections:
		* `netstat -anp [-antl] [-rn]`
		* `ss -anp`
	* Check `/etc/resolv.conf`, `/etc/hosts` for DNS configurations.
	* Enumerate arp table: `arp -a`
	* Firewall rules enumeration:
		* `iptables` requires root privileges.
		* `/etc/iptables` files can be worth a shot. Programs such as `iptables-persistent` package or `netfilter` save and use rules in these files and are left with weak permissions.
		* `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore` are commands used to dump or restore firewall configuration rules. As an example firewall rules can saved to a file `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`. If the file has weak permissions it can viewed.
	* Check for config files in Exec Shield, AppArmor, SELinux, Fail2ban, Snort, Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)
	* Check for files in each users' directory on `/home`
	* Scheduled tasks: 
		* `crontab -l` lists current user's cron jobs.
		* `ls -lah /etc/cron*` and `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root` for all scripts stored related to cron. These can be checked for weak file permissions.
	* Enumerating installed applications:
		* For Debian, can enumerate applications installed by dpkg package manager: `dpkg -l`
		* For Red Hat, can enumerate applications installed by rpm package manager.
		* Enumerate packages from apt: `apt list --installed | tr "/" " " | cut -d" " -f1,3 | sed 's/[0-9]://g' | tee -a installed_pkgs.list`
	* Enumerate mail boxes: `/var/spool/mail` or `/var/mail`
	* Enumerate binaries in path: `ls -lah /bin /usr/bin /usr/sbin <... add other directries from path variable>` 
	* Check for shells in`/etc/shells` and check for vulnerabilities in shell versions.
	* Search for `.ssh` folders in users' home directory that can be accessible. 
		* Check for other locations to search for ssh keys.
	* Enumerate files with writable permissions by the current user: `find / -writable 2>/dev/null` or `find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null`
	* Enumerate files with readable by the current user: `find / -readable 2>/dev/null` 
	* Enumerate files with setuid bit in file permissions: `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
	*  Enumerate files with setgid bit in file permissions: `find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
	* Enumerate hidden files: `find / -type f -name ".*" -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null`
	* Enumerate hidden directories: `find / -type d -name ".*" -ls 2>/dev/null`
	* Search for files using keywords: `find / -name *[.extension] 2>/dev/null | xargs cat | grep "<keyword>"`
		* extension can be something like .sh, .txt, .config, .conf, .php etc
	* Enumerate proc filesystem: `find /proc -name <name> -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | tr " " "\n"`
	* Check binaries with GTFObins to check for binary abuse:
		* `for i in $(curl -s https://gtfobins.github.io/ | html2text | cut -d" " -f1 | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d');do if grep -q "$i" installed_pkgs.list;then echo "Check GTFO for: $i";fi;done`
	* Trace system calls of a process: `strace <command>`
	* Enumerated mounted and unmount drives:
		* `mount` command lists all mounted drives.
		* `/etc/fstab` lists all drives that are mounted at boot time. 
		* `lsblk` lists available disks.`
	* Enumerate information on printers: `lpstat`
	* Enumerate loaded drivers and kernel modules: 
		* `lsmod` lists loaded kernel modules.
		* `sbin/modinfo <module name>` provides more info about a module.
* Automated enumeration:
	* unix-privesc-check:
		* Usage: `unix-privesc-check { standard | detailed }`
		* Standard is speed optimized. Detailed is slower but checks for permissions of open file handles and files.
