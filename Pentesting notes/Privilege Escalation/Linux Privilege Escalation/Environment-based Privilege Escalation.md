* `$PATH` variable abuse:
	* If you can write files in a directory in the PATH variable, write a malicious file that can be accessed by highly privileged process or service or cron job.
	* Alternatively if PATH variable can edited then prepend PATH with a malicious directory `PATH=<add your directory>:$PATH` then a hhighly privileged process or service or cron job that is searching for a binary can instead use the binary in the malicious directories.
* Wildcard abuse:
	* If a highly privileged process or service or cron job is using tar with * to tar files then files can be named as `--checkpoint=1`,`--checkpoint-action=exec=sh` which is used to invoke shell. create other file which can for example be named as `ls` to execute ls.
	* Example: set up files to execute `tar -zcf /home/htb-student/backup.tar.gz --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh`
