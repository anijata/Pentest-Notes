* Setuid,setgid binaries abuse:
	* Enumerate files with setuid bit in file permissions: `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
	*  Enumerate files with setgid bit in file permissions: `find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
	* Check if the binaries can be abused using GTFObins if setuid, setgid bits are enabled.
*  Linux capabilities abuse
	* Capabilities are pieces of privileges that can be assigned to a file. 
	* List capabilities of file in directory recursively using: `/usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null` or `find / -type f -exec getcap {} \;`
	* Capabilities can have effective bit (e) and permitted bit (p) assigned. Effective bit means the capability is currently active. Permitted means the file is allowed to use the capability.
	* [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#+capabilities) contains techniques for a list of binaries on how to abuse binaries with capabilities assigned. 
	*  If something goes wrong, try checking `/var/log/syslog`.
* Abusing Sudo:
	* List sudo allow commands of the current user: `sudo -l`
	* See what commands can be used to read, write, execute files.
	* [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#+capabilities) contains techniques for a list of binaries on how to abuse binaries with sudo.
	* sudoers abuse:
		* If the sudoers file is somehow editable then adding `<insert user> ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` can allow unrestricted sudo usage without password. 
*  Check if shadow file is readable and if there are any password hashes in `/etc/passwd`.
